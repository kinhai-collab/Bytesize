## Packages
react-player | For embedding YouTube videos easily
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and micro-interactions

## Notes
The backend provides /api/videos endpoints.
Video summarization is an async process, so the UI needs to handle loading/processing states gracefully.
We will use 'Outfit' for headings and 'DM Sans' for body text to create a modern, tech-forward aesthetic.
